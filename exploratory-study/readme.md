This folder contains a zip file for each instance that was analyzed in the exploratory study performed 
to characterize the solution space for the JavaScript source code size reduction problem. Each zip file
contains the following directories:

* GA: contains the original program (original.js) and one file generated by each optimization round
  using the genetic algorithm (x.js, x varying from 0 to 59). These files were produced by the 
  optimizer;

* RD: contains the original program (original.js) and one file generated by each optimization round
  using the stochastic hill climbing algorithm (x.js, x varying from 0 to 59). The directory was 
  named after random search, as we believed we were running a random search at first. These files 
  were produced by the optimizer;

* GA-minified: contains minified versions for the files in the GA directory. These files are created
  using "uglify-es". The "scripts/create-minified-files" directory contains an Excel worksheet that
  helps creating the batch commands to execute uglify-es;
  
* RD-minified: same as above, for the files in the RD directory;

* text-diff: contains textual diffs generated using a diff program, such as ExamDiff for Windows.
  These diffs are based on the the source code deposited in the RD directory of the instance under
  analysis, comparing each program variant generated by the SHC algorithm with its original code;

  
Besides the directories storing instance information and the scripts used to generate their data,
the scripts directory have some scripts used to generate information reported in the paper:

* Table 2 was generated using the script in "calc-minified-improvements", that uses the source
  code in the "RD-minified" and "GA-minified" directories of each instance to compute statistics
  about the improvements obtained by optimization rounds using SHC;

* Table 3 was generated using the "calc-list-patches/calc-patch-size-distance.r" script that uses
  the "patches.csv" file generated by the "calc-list-patches/list-patches.js" script. The latter
  scans the textual diffs on an instance basis to determine the starting and finishing line of 
  every patch made by an optimization round using SHC;

* Table 4 was generated using the "calc-list-patches/calc-patch-frequency.r" script that uses
  the "patches.csv" file described above;

* Figure 1 was generated using the "calc-list-patches/create-barcode-chart.r" script that reads 
  the "patches.csv" file described above;

* Table 5 was generated using the script "calc-count-topmost/count-topmost.js" script to count 
  the topmost node types for all instances under analysis and save this information to the 
  "topmost-count-shc.csv" file. This file is then processed by the "calc-count-topmost/
  calc-node-type-importance.r" to calculate the rank of each node type and create the 
  "node-importance.csv" file with the data reported in Table 5.
