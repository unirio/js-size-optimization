This folder contains one directory for each algorithm used in the evaluation of the proposed local
search based optimization: DFAHC, SFAHC, and SHC. Each directory has a subdirectory containing the 
variant of the target program produced by each optimization round executed for the respective 
algorithm (1 for DFAHC, 10 for SFAHC and 10 for SHC) as well as the original source code. The 
directory for each algorithm also has a CSV file containing the original number of chars in the
minified version of each target program and the number of chars for the variant produced by each
optimization round.

Table 8 was generated by the "calc-improvement/calc-improvements.js" script, that reads the CSV files
mentioned above and  creates the "improvements.csv" file. This script also calculates the WMW tests
mentioned in the analysis, as well as a set of correlations.

The boxplots in Figure 2 were generated by the "calc-boxplots/calc-boxplots.r" script, also based on
the CSV files mentioned above.

All analysis from RQ1 to RQ4 are performed by the scripts under this directory.
